# Mass-based-dissimilarity
This software calculates the mass-based dissimilarity matrix for data mining algorithms relying on a distance measure.

Main.m illustrates a contour of the scores produced by k-nearest neigbour anomaly detector using distance and m_e, as shown in Figure 8 in the original paper.
